Factions - Guilding and user-controlled antigrief plugin for Minecraft
====================
This plugin will allow the players on the server to create factions/guilds. The factions can claim territory that will be protected from non-members. Factions can forge alliances and declare themselves enemies with others. Land may be taken from other factions through war.

The goals of this plugin:

 * The players should be able to take care of anti-griefing themselves.
 * Inspire politics and intrigues on your server.
 * Guilding and team spirit! :)

Usage
---------

The chat console command is:

 * `/f`

This command has subcommands like:

* `/f create MyFactionName`
* `/f invite MyFriendsName`
* `/f claim`
* `/f map`
* ... etc

You may also read the documentation ingame as the plugin ships with an ingame help manual. Read the help pages like this:

* `/f help 1`
* `/f help 2`
* `/f help 3`

Note that you may optionally skip the slash and just write

* `f`

Installing
----------
1. Compile using github and Maven. Once this is stable I will release it.
1. Put Factions.jar in the plugins folder.

A default config file will be created on the first run.
